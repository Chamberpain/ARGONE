# ARGONE

## Installation and setup
The data and scripts found in this repository can be installed by running
```
git clone 
```
I recommend using conda for package management. Instruction for how to create a new environment in Conda can be found [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands). After activating your new environment, you will need to install some dependencies to run this code. If you are running conda, these dependencies can be installed with the following commands: 
```
conda install ipython 
conda install pandas
conda install scipy   
conda install matplotlib
conda install -c conda-forge geopy
conda install shapely
conda install -c conda-forge folium
```
